# 🛡️ Android Security Checker - Backend Service

This backend service works alongside the **Android Security Checker** to log security events from Android devices. It helps **game companies** detect suspicious activity such as **unsigned APKs, rooted devices, and multiple security flags**.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Receives security data from the Android app  
✅ Logs suspicious activity (e.g., unsigned APK, root detection)  
✅ Sends alerts when a game account is flagged multiple times  
✅ Can be hosted on any **server (AWS, VPS, Firebase, or local machine)**  
✅ Supports **Python (Flask), Node.js (Express), or PHP**  

---

## 📡 How It Works
1. The **Android app** checks if an APK is signed and detects root access.  
2. If suspicious activity is found, the app **sends data** to this backend service.  
3. The backend **logs the event** and stores it in a database or file.  
4. If an account is flagged **3 times**, an **alert is triggered** for manual review.
